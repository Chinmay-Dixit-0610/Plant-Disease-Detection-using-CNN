# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-CNN
This project trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify plant disease images into three categories: *healthy*, *powdery*, and *rust*. The model is trained on preprocessed images, then used to predict plant disease on new test images. Results are visualized by comparing predicted and actual labels.
